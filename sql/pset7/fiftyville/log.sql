-- I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized.
-- Earlier this morning, before I arrived at the courthouse, I was walking by the ATM on Fifer Street
-- and saw the thief there withdrawing some money.

-- As the thief was leaving the courthouse, they called someone who
-- talked to them for less than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning

--  thief drove away within 10 minutes
